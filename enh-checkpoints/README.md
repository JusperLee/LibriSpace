# ðŸ¤— Speech Enhancement Checkpoints

Welcome to the Checkpoints folder! Here you will find instructions on how to download and set up pre-trained speech enhancement models for testing.

## Instructions

1. **Download Pre-trained Models**:
    - Visit the [GitHub Release page](https://github.com/JusperLee/LibriSpace/releases) of the LibriSpace repository.
    - Download the desired pre-trained model files. Each model is available as a zip file named according to the following list:
    
2. **Extract the Models**:
    - Extract the downloaded zip files into this `LibriSpace/enh-checkpoints` folder. Each zip file contains the pre-trained model weights and necessary files for model testing.

3. **Test the Models**:
    - Once extracted, you can use the models for testing purposes with your speech enhancement tasks. Ensure that your testing scripts point to the correct model paths.
